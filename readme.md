# Particle Graph

This is just a fun p5js sketch project to animate a particle system with random valocities which will connect to one another after entering a given range

To run this project, you can simply open the index.html file in any browser and watch it go! It doesn't do anything more than that. This is all you get with this one. This was based on Brad Traversy's YouTube tutorial [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-9jCNhLe-Q)
